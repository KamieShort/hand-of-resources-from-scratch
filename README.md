# Hand of Resources Plan

## Resources

- dogs (name, breed, age)
- campervans (make, model, builder)
- food (name, type, ingredients)
- coffee (name, flavor, roast)
- campgrounds (name, location, features)

Work vertically. Build the tests, route and model for one entity/resource at a time.
Each table will have 3 fields. 4 rows per table.
